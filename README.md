### LLA
A C++20 linear algebra static library.

#### *Ô∏è‚É£ Description
This library provides two template classes: Vector and Matrix, as well as many of the operations than can be performed on them.

It also contains a Complex number class.

It is suited for any C++ project relying on mathematics and linear algebra.

Furthermore, LLA provides methods to convert vectors and matrices to OpenGL format, and functions to generate projection, translation or rotation matrices for graphics projects.

#### üì¶ Installation and usage
To compile the library, just clone the repository and make the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/Samael1254/LLA
cd LLA
make
```
The resulting library file is located in the `lib/` directory.

#### ‚è© Future improvements
- Adding Quaternions
- Adding more matrix creation functions (view and normal matrices, diagonal matrices, orthographic projections...)
